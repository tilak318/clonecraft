## Chrome/Puppeteer Issue on Render

The main issue you're experiencing is that **Chrome is not available in the Render deployment environment**. This is a common problem when deploying Puppeteer applications.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Automatic Chrome Installation
- Added `postinstall` script to automatically install Chrome during deployment
- Added `build` script to ensure Chrome is available before starting the server

### 2. Fallback Scraper Service
- Created `FallbackScraperService` that uses HTTP requests instead of browser automation
- Automatically switches to fallback mode when Puppeteer fails
- Provides similar functionality using `axios` and `cheerio`

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Multiple fallback configurations for Puppeteer
- Automatic detection of Chrome availability
- Graceful degradation to HTTP-based scraping

## Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Render with Chrome Installation (Recommended)

1. **Deploy to Render** using the provided `render.yaml`:
   ```bash
   # The render.yaml file will automatically:
   # - Install Chrome during build
   # - Set proper environment variables
   # - Configure health checks
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** (automatically set by render.yaml):
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR=/opt/render/.cache/puppeteer`
   - `PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=false`

### Option 2: Manual Render Configuration

If not using `render.yaml`, configure your Render service:

1. **Build Command**: `npm run build`
2. **Start Command**: `npm start`
3. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR=/opt/render/.cache/puppeteer
   PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=false
   ```

### Option 3: Alternative Deployment Platforms

If Render continues to have issues, consider:

1. **Railway**: Better support for Puppeteer
2. **Heroku**: Has buildpacks for Chrome
3. **DigitalOcean App Platform**: Good container support
4. **AWS Lambda**: Serverless with Chrome layers

## How the Fallback System Works

1. **Primary Method**: Puppeteer with Chrome
   - Tries to initialize Chrome browser
   - Uses full browser automation
   - Captures dynamic content and JavaScript-rendered resources

2. **Fallback Method**: HTTP-based scraping
   - Uses `axios` for HTTP requests
   - Uses `cheerio` for HTML parsing
   - Captures static resources (CSS, JS, images, fonts)
   - Works without Chrome installation

3. **Automatic Switching**:
   - Detects Chrome availability during first scrape
   - Switches to fallback mode permanently if Chrome fails
   - Provides seamless user experience

## Testing the Deployment

### Test Environment Endpoint
```
GET /api/test-environment
```
This endpoint tests:
- Puppeteer availability
- Chrome installation
- Network connectivity
- File system access

### Test Scrape Endpoint
```
GET /api/test-scrape/example.com
```
This endpoint tests:
- Browser initialization
- Page navigation
- Resource extraction
- Fallback system

## Troubleshooting

### Chrome Installation Issues
If Chrome installation fails:
1. Check build logs for errors
2. Verify `PUPPETEER_CACHE_DIR` is writable
3. Ensure sufficient disk space
4. Check memory limits

### Fallback Mode Issues
If fallback mode fails:
1. Check network connectivity
2. Verify target website accessibility
3. Check CORS policies
4. Review error logs

### Performance Optimization
1. **Memory Usage**: Monitor memory consumption
2. **Timeout Settings**: Adjust timeouts for slow websites
3. **Resource Limits**: Set appropriate limits for large sites
4. **Caching**: Implement caching for repeated requests

## Monitoring and Logs

The application provides detailed logging:
- Browser initialization status
- Scraping progress and statistics
- Error details and fallback attempts
- Performance metrics

Check Render logs for:
- Build process completion
- Chrome installation success
- Service startup status
- Scraping operation results

## Expected Behavior

After deployment:
1. **First Request**: May take longer as Chrome installs
2. **Subsequent Requests**: Faster with cached Chrome
3. **Fallback Mode**: Automatic if Chrome fails
4. **Mixed Mode**: Some requests use Puppeteer, others use fallback

The system is designed to be resilient and provide consistent service regardless of the underlying environment constraints.
